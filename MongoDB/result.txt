I run a real estate & property management company in Tokyo since 2006.  Nice to meet you and thank you for checking my profile and listings.  I have been using AirBnB since 2011 for my travels in Europe and had a really great time in all the places I stopped over. I really love European cities, food, wine and cheeese!    Since this website do not support monthly rental apartment my listing you can see online is getting small. However still I manage several different apartments as always and welcoming monthly stayers from all over the world. If you plan to stay in Tokyo over a month please feel free to contact me. I have many different apartments in several areas of Tokyo city.   As I had no trouble and really enjoyed staying at AirBnB hosts' homes, I decided to provide a similar and even better service in Tokyo. Therefore, I hope my apartments will provide you a pleasant and comfortable stay during your travel to thrilling Tokyo!  If you have any questions or inquiries during your stay, I would be happy to help you. I am looking forward to welcoming you in one of my apartments. :) N/A N/A N/A t https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/151977/profile_pic/1312268142/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/151977/profile_pic/1312268142/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium Shibuya District 3 3 ['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'government_id', 'work_email'] t t Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan Shibuya District Shibuya Ku  Shibuya Tokyo 150-0001 Tokyo Shibuya, Japan JP Japan 35.67152 139.71203 t Apartment Private room 1 1.0 1 1 Real Bed {TV,Internet,Wifi,Kitchen,"Paid parking off premises",Elevator,Heating,Washer,Dryer,"Smoke detector","Fire extinguisher",Essentials,"Lock on bedroom door","Hair dryer","Hot water",Other}  $4,196.00  $110,000.00 $30,000.00 $5,000.00 1 $0.00 28 1125 28 28 1125 1125 28.0 1125.0 8 months ago t 0 0 0 0 2019-06-27 18 1 2011-12-28 2018-07-28 94 9 9 9 10 10 9 t Other reasons |  弊社は不動産事業者であり賃貸住宅管理事業者でもあります。当該物件については、家主の許可を得てサブリースを行い入居者とは１カ月以上～１年未満での短期定期借家契約を結んだうえで賃貸をしています。この為、民泊には該当せず弊社の免許でもって対応しております。 賃貸住宅管理業　国土交通大臣(1)第3606号 宅地建物取引業者  f f strict_14_with_grace_period f f 3 2 1 0 0.20]
